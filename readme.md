This is a project that tests and adjusts basic lists, as well as other webdev basics.

I am to make this around hangover cure meals.

Once completed I should have displayed:
    - boilerplate 
    - basic html
    - ordered lists
    - unstructured lists
    - links
    - images
    - and maybe some other things.
